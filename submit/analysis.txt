TASK0
Input size = O(n) for both exercises
To access ith element, addr(a[0]) + i*size(object). 
This term is independent of n, so it is  O(1).


TASK1

iterates n times, so if both exercises has O(1) running time,
 then the loop as a whole has O(n) running time.
the program takes less time to complete and uses less space

TASK2

Similar to TASK1, the loop as a whole has O(n) running time. for both steps in the exercise

TASK3

takes 7 steps to complete with individual for loops that have O(n) running time

TASK4

Takes 2 steps to complete with individual for loops that have O(n) running time
